- How the program will flow


Rain, snow flurries

Develop a system to generate realistic animation of rain and snow. The student should pay attention to the following areas
  Artist control
  Realism Should time allow, the student may also like to consider the following
  Interaction with environment and characters
  Rendering

    plan:
    Option for user to generate snow or rain in the scene (3D), can be used for animation scene. The snow will pile up overtime, rain will not,
    snow and rain will interact will objects as well (water splashing off the roof)

    How the program will flow:
    I am not sure at the moment

    Design of classes / data structures:
    class for falling speed, air resistsance, gravity, direction, collision? 

    Questions I am not sure about:

    could I import my particle system into MAYA?
    
    I am not sure where to start, should I use the particle system you provided during the lectures as a base? or do I need to create new .h libraries for rain and snow?

    does the particle test file you provided work on other particle systems?

    Lastly, I am not sure how to set up the whole NGL setup. Could you tell me the about what are the first few steps i should do to sart my rain/snow particle system in order for me to follow up?
